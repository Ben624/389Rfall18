### Part 2 (75 pts) 

If I found some severe security problems with the ECU firmware, the first person I would tell would be my boss. Since my boss would be the person that I am reporting to on a daily basis and working under, it would ethically be the right thing to report to him/her first before resorting to other options. Going behind my boss's back would be very unethical since it just wouldn't be the right thing to do and would also probably go against some contract I would have signed before starting the job. If my boss didn't do anything about the situation, then I would tell a consumer watchdog, since they help protect the interests of people who purchase products. Hopefully, with their help, they would be able to convince the company to fix the issue as fast as possible. If people knew that their cars were at risk of being damaged and hacked, they would have been hesitant to purchase the vehicle in the first place. Finally, if the car company still did not proceed with getting the issue fixed, I would inform the public since it's their right to know that their car is vulnerable to major attacks that impact its safety. By informing the public, the car company would essentially be forced to fix the issue quickly. By publishing this information publicly, it may encourage some people to go out and try to hack these cars, but I still believe in the long run, more people would benefit with the information being made publcly available.

If I chose to not do anything about this issue, I would feel responsible for any resulting harm, since it was my job to share any vulnerabilities and issues I found with the system. The issue presented is a huge issue and could potentially cause serious injury to individuals if nothing was done to address the vulnerability.
